# Covid-Strain-Prediction
In this project, the aim is to classify the clinical reports 
obtained using classical and ensemble machine learning models with Grid Search 
hyperparameter tuning after the chi square feature selection technique to discover the
underlying presence of the novel coronavirus in an individual and to perform an 
analysis of how its performance varies when the classification task is performed by 
the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, that falls under the category of Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANN) and is mainly known to parts of the Deep Learning sphere. 
The feature engineering process is carried out using NLP Techniques such as Term 
Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF), which used to discern the 
relevance of a particular word to the entire document in addition to Bag of Words 
(BOW) model that can be used to extract the 40 predominant features that can be 
deployed to obtain a precise classification of the various COVID-19 strains after the 
reports have been preprocessed. The conventional machine learning models such as 
Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression along with 
ensemble learning techniques such as Gradient boost and Bagging classification 
algorithms are tuned with Grid Search techniques to observe its accuracy. RNN being 
a developed Artificial Intelligence (AI) model based on the working principle of the 
neurons in humans has been utilized in a number of applications till date spread over 
various domains. However, there doesn’t exist any work prior to this that implements 
RNN for the classification of COVID strains in the diagnostic reports of the patients 
suffering from the coronavirus. Thus, a RNN model is proposed to accurately 
determine the patients who are infected with COVID and the strain that they are 
affected with by processing the clinical reports to retrieve the sequential data that has 
to be fed into the model. This COVID strain prediction system is similar to a text 
classification system in its application. Further, the prediction accuracy of the 
traditional algorithms is compared to that of RNN to determine the better algorithm 
in the classification of COVID-19 strains. Further, the scope of the project can be 
extended to outbreak prediction.
